# iPonv2.0


iPON is an application that wants to educate users to prioritize SAVING than SPENDING. 
The application will teach the user that they should save at least 20% of their allowance. 
iPon will provide the essentials of having a modern budget reminder and a tracker as well.


This is an Mobile Application that we(MULTICORE) created during our thesis. 

I will upgrade the design and refactor the codes.
